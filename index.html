    <h1>Island of Knowledge</h1>
    
    <h2>Great Visualization</h2>

    <ol>
    
    <li>
    The data is portrayed in a straight, matter of fact manner which helps to fulfill Cairo’s guidelines of being truthful. The data also has a singular axis to mark the percentages for the two axis, which further indicates that the data is being handled well.
    </li>
    <li>
    The purpose of the chart is clearly to show the fluctuations in approval ratings over time, which it accomplishes cleanly in the chart, showing both averages and the areas which fall into a margin of error, thus fulfilling Cairo’s requirement for the chart to be functional.
    </li>
    <li>
    The chart is beautiful, fulfilling Cairo’s third requirement because the colors are complementary and the mouse-over effect allows you to see the specific breakdown at any point in time. 
    </li>
    <li>
    The visualization is insightful because it provides the knowledge-building insight of plain survey results, which allow readers to form their own opinions about the meaning of the data. 
    </li>
    <li>
    The chart is enlightening because the data presented is relevant to the current world, providing an analysis of US president’s popularity over time. It is also provides the same chart for different presidents, so further insight can be gained through examination of the charts for other leaders.
    </li>
        
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Terrible Visualization</h2>

    <ol>
    <li>
    This chart is not truthful because the data is not portrayed in a way which is clear and free of bias. The numbers are placed seemingly at random and the colors and divisions are simply confusing and misleading.
    </li>
    <li>
     The chart is not at all functional because it is not readable. The stated purpose is to show federal subsidies, which are seemingly written and indicated, but the delivery is unclear and confusing. 
    </li>
    <li>
    The colors are pretty, but it is not beautiful if it confuses the reader. The layout is pretty and looks impressive, but the functionality is still important when it comes to visualizations.   
    </li>
    <li>
    The chart fails to be insightful because it does not effectively accomplish its purpose. This means that the chart does not fit Cairo’s requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
    This chart may be enlightening if it were truthful and functional. However, it is neither so it is impossible for it to be insightful because the reader cannot understand the data easily in the format in which it is presented. 
    </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>The Island...</h2>
    
    <h3>The good one...</h3>
    
    <p>This visualization helps to expand the island of knowledge by communicating an understanding of president Trump’s approval ratings while he was in office. This prompts the curiosity to what other presidents’ approval ratings were, which the site provides. These visualizations will further expand the island of knowledge, but at the same time expanding the shore of curiosity because the patterns in those charts beg to be explained by historical events.</p>
    
    <h3>The bad one...</h3>
    
    <p>This visualization does not effectively expand the island of knowledge because it is too convoluted to convey knowledge and create understanding. This means that in turn, the shoreline of curiosity is also not expanded, keeping the reader stranded in the sea of mystery. </p>
